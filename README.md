## 1. Business Concept
NoTip.US is an innovative platform designed to transform the dining experience by promoting fairness and transparency in tipping practices. The service connects consumers with restaurants, cafes, and other dining establishments that adopt no-tip or fair-tip policies. These policies prioritize ethical compensation by ensuring employees receive fair wages and do not rely solely on tips for their income.

### 1.1 Core Features:

#### 1. Empowering Ethical Dining Choices:
- Provides a platform for consumers to discover and support establishments where tipping is not required or is maintained within fair boundaries.
- Highlights restaurants that pay employees fairly, ensuring a stable income independent of tips.

#### 2. Promoting No-Tip and Fair-Tip Policies:
- **No-tip establishments:** Do not accept tips, relying on fair wages for employees.
- **Fair-tip establishments:** Encourage tipping within reasonable limits or ensure employees receive a minimum wage, with tips being a bonus rather than a necessity.

#### 3. Encouraging Transparency and Sustainability:
- Supports businesses that prioritize fairness and ethical practices, creating an ecosystem where consumers and businesses benefit from aligned values.

#### 4. Enhancing Business Visibility and Growth:
- Enables restaurants to showcase strengths like good service, taste, pricing, and ambiance, further increasing their market appeal.

#### 5. Data for Impact:
- Incorporates external data, such as hygiene ratings, to further enhance the user experience and promote transparency.
- Displays only positive reviews to users, while negative reviews are visible only to business managers to help improve their services. This approach aligns with the service's objective of promoting establishments and avoiding legal and reputational risks.
- Uses external data from platforms like Google and Yelp to generate insights about establishments lacking sufficient user-generated content at launch. These insights are used to showcase strengths and attract users.

#### 6. Future Promotional Opportunities:
- The platform also has the potential to support promotional activities, enabling establishments to pay for increased visibility and targeted advertising.
- However, due to current visa limitations, which restrict obtaining a business license and using payment gateways, this functionality is planned for future development. Once these legal and operational constraints are resolved, the platform will expand to offer paid promotional services to further support ethical establishments.
